SHAMan is an out-of-the-box Web application to perform black-box auto-tuning of custom computer components running on a distributed system, for an application submitted by a user. It relies on black-box auto-tuning to find the components' parametrization that are the most efficient in terms of execution time.

# Main goal and features

SHAMan is a framework to perform auto-tuning of configurable component running on HPC distributed systems. It performs the auto-tuning loop by parametrizing the component, submitting the job through the Slurm workload manager, and getting the corresponding execution time. Using the combination of the history (parametrization and execution time), the framework then uses black-box optimization to select the next most appropriate parametrization, up until the number of allocated runs is over.

This framework integrates three state-of-art heuristics, as well as noise reduction strategies to deal with the possible interference of shared resources for large scale HPC systems, and pruning strategies to limit the time spent by the optimization process.

Compared to already existing softwares, it provides these main advantages:

:rocket: **Accessibility**: the optimization engine is accessible either through a Web Interface or a CLI

:rocket: **Easy to extend**: the optimization engine uses a plug-in architecture and the development of the heuristic is thus the only development cost

:rocket: **Integrated within the HPC ecosystem**: the framework relies on the Slurmworkload manager to run HPC applications. The microservice architecture enables it to have no concurrent interactions with the cluster and the application itself.

:rocket: **Flexible for a wide range of use-cases**: new components can be registered through a generalist configuration file.

:rocket: **Integrates noise reduction strategies**: because of their highly dynamic nature and the complexity of applications and software stacks, HPC systems are subject to many interference when running in production, which results in a different performance measure for each run even with the same system’s parametrization. Noise reduction strategies are included in the framework to perform well even in the case of strong interference.

:rocket: **Integrates pruning strategies**: runs with unsuited parametrization are aborted, to speed-up the convergence process

# Basic architecture

SHAMan relies on a microservice architecture and integrates:

- A front-end Web application, running with [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)
- A back-end storage database, relying on [MongoDB](www.mongodb.com/)
- An optimization engine, reached by the API through a message broker, and which uses runners to perform optimization tasks, written in Python

The several services communicate through a REST API, using [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).

# Installation

SHAMan can be installed in a containerized environment, as several docker containers run with `docker-compose`. However, this type of install is only suitable for demo purpose: it is not possible to infer proper performance metrics from hardwares or softwares when the optimization engine is running in a containerized environment. 

In both cases, the latest version of SHAMan pust be pulled by cloning this repository. The user must then move to the cloned repository.

## Demo deployment

:warning: This version requires a working install of docker and docker compose.

The demo version of the application can be run by calling:

```
docker-compose -f demo-docker-compose.yml up
```

:warning: If the user wants data persistence, a volume must be declared in the docker-compose file.

Once the application is up and running, visit `localhost:3000` and check that you can access the web interface.

## Production deployment

:warning: This version requires a working install of docker, the possibility to install Python libraries on a node that has access to the Slurm cluster (login node or compute node).

The deployment of SHAMan in production is described in the [documentation](https://shaman-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

# Registering a new component

Running the command `shaman-install` with a YAML file describing a component registers it to the application. This YAML file must describe how the component is launched and declares its different parameters and how they must be used to parametrize the component. After the installation process, the components are available in the launch menu of the Web interface.

```
components:
  component_1:
    cli_command: example_1
    header: example_header
    command: example_cmd
    ld_preload: example_lib
    parameters:
      param_1:
        env_var: True
        type: int
        default: 1
      param_2:
        cmd_var: True
        type: int
        default: 100
        flag: test
      param_3:
        cli_var: True
        type: int
        default: 1

  component_2:
  ...
```

This component can be activated through options passed on the job's command line, a command called at the top of the script or the setting of the `LD_PRELOAD` variable.

The `header` variable is a command written at the top of the script and that is called between each optimization round, before running the job. For instance, a clear cache command is called when tuning I/O accelerators to ensure independence between runs.

The parameters with a default value, can be either passed:

- As an environment variable (`env_var=True`)
- As a variable appended to the command line variable with a flag (`cmd_var=True`)
- As a variable passed on the job's command line (`cli_var=True|`)

# Creating an experiment

To launch an experiment through the `/create` menu of the Web interface, the optimization experiment should be parametrized by:

- Writing an application according to Slurm sbatch format.
- Selecting the component and the parametric grid through the radio buttons (minimal, maximal and step value).
- Configuring the optimization heuristic, chosen freely among available ones. Resampling parametrization and pruning strategies can also be activated.

Once the experiment is created and launched, it is available for real-time vizualization in the `/launch` menu of the Web interface.

For an explaination on how to launch an experiment using a command line interface, go to [the documentation](https://shaman-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/launching/).
