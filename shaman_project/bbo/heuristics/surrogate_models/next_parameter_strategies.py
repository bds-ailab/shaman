"""This module contains different strategies used to compute the next point to
evaluate when modeling the function with surrogate models. There exists in the
literature three main methods to compute this parameter:

- Using the surrogate model as the merit function and look for its minimum by
using various heuristics (CMA, LBFGS, etc ...)
- Using some probabilistic properties of the surrogate model (for example after
having regressed it using Gaussian Processes) and using those properties to
compute "probability of improvements" or expected gains.
